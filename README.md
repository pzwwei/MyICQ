MyICQ
=====

My version of good old ICQ messenger written in C#. 
The program uses the WCF technology for net communication, the WPF technology for design, xml file for storing user data.

If you want to only test the functionality of the messenger run "demo.bat" (starts the server and the two instances of the client part).
The user data (usernames, passwords) can be taken from the file "accounts.xml"
