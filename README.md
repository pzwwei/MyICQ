MyICQ
=====

My version of the good old ICQ messenger written in C#. 
The program uses the WCF framework for net communication, the WPF technology for design, xml file for storing user data.

If you want to only test the functionality of the messenger run "demo.bat" (it starts the server and two instances of the client app).
The user data (usernames, passwords) can be taken from the file "accounts.xml"
